                            Welcome!</br> We'd like to invite you to the 2nd version of the Winter Acro Festival in
                            Lenk, Switzerland. It's going to take place from:</br>
                            <u>22 till 27 of February 2019</u></br>
                            With the experience of 2018 we made some upgrades:
                            For starters we have <u>6 days of festival, 11 rounds of acro workshops</u>
                            and handpicked teachers, but more about them later :).
                            There are some additional handstands, yoga and thai massage classes planned ;).
                            Since we're in the mountains we'll add some <u>snow activities</u>. To close,
                            this year - after hard training - we have saunas you can enjoy in the evening.</br>

                                    I'll be honest, first encounter was a bit intimidating. But then you go full FKK at
                                    some random acro conventions and you realise we're all in the same rail here (sort of).<br>
                                    It's endless what you could learn from this couple of amazing acrobats!<br>
                                    Wybren is teacher at the Codarts Circus School in Rotterdam and with Trudi they have

                                    It's been very nice to see how this friends have grown so fast and good in their Acro paths. Touring 
                                    with their acro company all arround europe, giving very nice workshops. Very happy to have them on Board!
                                    We picked them up in Berlin and Graz to bring them direct to Lenk yuhuiii!

                                    I had to laugh only from remembering Bruno at the French acro convention, what a
                                    blast you'll have with this guy! Improvisation and staging are he's strengths and
                                    passion. But it's hard to find the words to describe such a clown, you just have
                                    to meet him. Happy to have you with us my friend!
