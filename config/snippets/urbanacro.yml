  But don't worry – the good stuff is all still here:<br>
  ✨ Top international teachers<br>
  ✨ Epic workshops & fun games<br>
  ✨ Evening sauna sessions<br>
  ✨ Delicious snacks throughout the day<br>
  ✨ Hall sleeping available (yes, you can crash on site!)<br><br>

  <strong>New this year:</strong><br>
  🌞 We're kicking off early on Friday – so you get a full 3 days of acro magic!<br>

  There is space in the training hall and the barn in the Zirkusquartier where we will find some spots for you to sleep. It's not a luxury accomodation and we only have around 25 spots. So, first come, first serve.
  Note: Bring your own sleeping bag and matt to sleep. <br><br>
